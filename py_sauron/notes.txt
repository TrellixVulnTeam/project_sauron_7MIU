# Common conventions

## Overloaded Naming
s_ is prefixed to variables for clarity if they may overlap with library functions
or are just incredibly overloaded terms. It can stand for sauron_ or single_
Really its up to your imagination.
For Example: s_item instead of item

I commonly use n_ for new
